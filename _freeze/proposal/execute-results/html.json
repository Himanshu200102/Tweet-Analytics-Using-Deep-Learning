By analyzing the conversations and trends on Twitter during such situations, the project aims to uncover patterns, validate the truthfulness of information, improve situational awareness, and ultimately contribute to the resilience and safety of individuals and communities faced with critical events.\\\nThe major motivation behind the proposed project is to save lives and improve public safety by harnessing the power of Twitter data to access real-time information, understand & validate public sentiment.\n\n## Dataset\n\nThis dataset has been taken from **Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets** competition. Twitter has become an important communication channel in times of emergency.\\\nThe ubiquitousness of smartphones enables people to announce an emergency they're observing in real-time. Because of this, more agencies are interested in programatically monitoring Twitter (i.e. disaster relief organizations and news agencies).\n\nThere are two main files associated with this dataset:\n\n-   train.csv - credibility ratings and reasoning entered by turkers\\*\\* for each topic. Each row has following tab separated fields:\n\n    **Data Glimpse**\n\n\n    ::: {.cell}\n    ::: {.cell-output-display}\n    <table class=\"table table-condensed\">\n     <thead>\n      <tr>\n       <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> id </th>\n       <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> keyword </th>\n       <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> location </th>\n       <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> text </th>\n       <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> target </th>\n      </tr>\n     </thead>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n       <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 66 </td>\n       <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> ablaze </td>\n       <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> GREENSBORO,NORTH CAROLINA </td>\n       <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> How the West was burned: Thousands of wildfire... </td>\n       <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1 </td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n    :::\n    :::\n\n\n    **Data Description**\n\n    | Column Name | Data Type       | Description                                                                                     |\n    |-------------|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n    | id          | Integer         | A unique identifier for each tweet                                                              |\n    | text        | List of strings | It contains the text of the tweet                                                               |\n    | location    | List of strings | The location the tweet was sent from (may be blank)                                             |\n    | keyword     | List of Strings | A particular keyword from the tweet (may be blank)                                              |\n    | target      | Integer         | in¬†**train.csv**¬†only, this denotes whether a tweet is about a real disaster (`1`) or not (`0`) |\n\n    This data set will be used to train the model on the credibility of the tweet\n\n-   test.csv - tweets corresponding to each topic fetched using the search API. Each row has following tab separated fields:\n\n    **Data Description**\n\n    | Column Name | Data Type       | Description                                         |\n    |-------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|\n    | id          | Integer         | A unique identifier for each tweet                  |\n    | text        | List of strings | It contains the text of the tweet                   |\n    | location    | List of strings | The location the tweet was sent from (may be blank) |\n    | keyword     | List of strings | A particular keyword from the tweet (may be blank)  |\n\n    This dataset will be used as an index to fetch and test specific types of disaster tweets (like earthquake).\n\nFor streaming API, we will be using tweepy, a python package meand for extracting real-time tweets using keywords. It will be authenticated using a developer account from the v2 API endpoint. This endpoint will serve on a free tier to fetch and consume streaming data from twitter (https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tutorials/consuming-streaming-data). The individual data streamed by this API are JSON encoded, and fall into the following types:\n\n-   Tweets: Individual Tweet JSON objects\n\n-   Keep-alive Signals: Carriage returns to prevent your connection from timing out\n\n-   System messages: E.g. notification of a force disconnect. Note that the actual disconnection is accomplished via normal HTTP protocols, rather than through the message itself. In some cases the disconnect system message may not arrive, making it critical that you monitor the keep-alive signal (see below for more information).\n\n    -   We will be utilizing the Tweet JSON (shown below) to analyze and classify them into real or fake. This can be particularly useful for disaster management departments, as the analysis of these tweets can help extract crucial information, such as the geolocation of the tweet, which can be used to send help to those in need.\n\n\n        ::: {.cell}\n        \n        ```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Expand to reveal Tweet JSON output\"}\n        {\n          \"created_at\": \"Thu Apr 06 15:24:15 +0000 2017\",\n          \"id_str\": \"850006245121695744\",\n          \"text\": \"1\\/ Today we\\u2019re sharing our vision for the future of the Twitter API platform!\\nhttps:\\/\\/t.co\\/XweGngmxlP\",\n          \"user\": {\n            \"id\": 2244994945,\n            \"name\": \"Twitter Dev\",\n            \"screen_name\": \"TwitterDev\",\n            \"location\": \"Internet\",\n            \"url\": \"https:\\/\\/dev.twitter.com\\/\",\n            \"description\": \"Your official source for Twitter Platform news, updates & events.

The credibility annotations in the CREDBANK data can aid in the fake/real classification, while the academictwitteR package can help in collecting real-time data for ongoing analysis.\n\n## Reason For Choosing This Source\n\nThese dataset's not only provide a large volume of data but also offer unique features that align well with our project's objectives. The combination of historical data from¬†`CREDBANK`¬†and real-time data from¬†`academictwitteR`¬†can provide a robust foundation for the tweet analysis application.\n\n## Problem Statement\n\nThe dynamic nature of disasters and calamities demands a proactive approach to information gathering and analysis. Traditional methods often fail to adapt quickly to evolving situations, hindering the ability of emergency responders to anticipate needs and allocate resources effectively. Furthermore, ensuring the reliability and credibility of the information shared on Twitter during these events is crucial, as misinformation and rumors can lead to panic and confusion among the affected population.\n\n## Analysis Plan\n\nFor the project, we are going to split into weekly milestones and attack the project in a piece by piece method. The goal is to build on the project an deploy a fully functional real-time classifier from the Twitter API. The plan is split into 6 weeks, with each of the key milestones described as follows:\n\n**Week 1:**\n\n**Avikal and Himanshu:**\n\n-   Dataset Exploration\n\n    -   Extract characteristics from the dataset, like UserID, Message Content, Location, etc.\n\n    -   Convert to Binary Classes.\n\n**Shakir and Poojitha:** - Data Preprocessing\n\n-   Null value and Duplicate value treatment.\n\n-   Text Cleaning (removing special characters, stop words).\n\n-   Split dataset into training and testing.\n\n**Visalakshi, Himanshu and Avikal:** - Feature Extraction\n\n-   Tokenization.\n\n-   Stemming.\n\n-   Lemmatization.\n\n**All members:** - Classification\n\n-   Train and validate the model.\n\n-   Test on new tweets.\n\n**Week 2:**\n\n-   **Avikal, Visalakshi and Shakir:** Extract entities from the tweet that include information about geo-location, disaster-type, severity, time elapsed, etc. using NER techniques.\n\n-   **Himanshu and Poojitha:** Link the entities to tweets and save the information.\n\n**Week 3:**\n\n-   **Visalakshi and Avikal:** Use python Tweepy to extract information and setup data flow.\n\n-   **Shakir:** Define filtering parameters to separate disaster-related tweets.\n\n-   **Poojitha and Himanshu:** Process and store the incoming tweet data along with the extracted results from the tweet data.\n\n**Week 4:**\n\n-   **Everyone:** Visualize the extracted output in a GUI. This will include showing geographic locations of the affected regions.\n\n-   **Everyone:** Add a dashboard to this GUI that provides better analysis of the extracted information.\n\n**Week 5:**\n\n-   **Avika;, Shakir and Visalakshi:** Create an interface for the analysis dashboard.\n\n-   **Visalakshi and Himanshu:** Use maps to indicate affected locations.\n\n-   **Poojitha:** Generate intelligent analytics on the type of disaster, time elapsed, severity, etc.\n\n**Week 6:**\n\n-   **Everyone:** Deploy the GUI and the data.\n\n-   **Everyone:** Make changes according to feedback.\n\n-   **Everyone:** Make the final presentation for showcase.\n\n::: callout-note\n## Note:\n\nThese are the planned approaches, and we intend to explore and solve the problem statement which we came up with. Parts of our approach might change in the final project.\n:::\n\n## Plan of Attack\n\n| Week            | Weekly Task                                                                                                                                       |\n|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| Week 1          | Proposal.                                                                                                                                         |\n| Week 2          | Data Exploration and Preprocessing.                                                                                                               |\n| Week 3 - Week 4 | Working on setting up the API and Extracting Feature using methods like Tokenization, lemmatization etc. and train Models and perform prediction. |\n| Week 5          | Visualize the output by working on developing a GUI.                                                                                              |\n| Week 6          | Finalizing the project and complete preparing a presentation.                                                                                     |\n\n*\\*\\* We have added respective members for individual tasks in the Analysis Plan.
